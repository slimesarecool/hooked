## Installation
Download the source code and then download luavit from here: https://luvit.io/install.html. Once both pieces of code are installed run: ```luavit example.lua``` and it will run just fine. The example file has tons of comments to help you. Since it's a small library you can read the source or the example, so there is no wiki.
