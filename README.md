# Hooked
Hooked is a simple easy to use library for making discord webhooks in lua. Although webhooks aren't generally hard to do, sending web requests in lua are hard. I spent hours finding a way to do it. I decided to package it up into hooked for the general public to use.\

## Example
<img src="example.png" alt="An image of hooked in use." width="411" height="571" />

## Installation
Download the source code and then download luavit from here: https://luvit.io/install.html. Once both pieces of code are installed run: ```luavit example.lua``` and it will run just fine.

## Help
Since it's a small library there is no wiki. You can read the source code or the example for help. If your still having issues join the discord for help: https://discord.gg/5WCkunrvvT.
